# TCP/IP Chat Application  

## Overview  
This project is a real-time chat system implemented in C++ using sockets and multithreading. The application consists of a **server** and a **client**, which communicate over TCP/IP to enable real-time message exchange. The server listens for incoming connections, and the client connects to the server to initiate a chat session.  

## Features  
- Uses **WinSock** API for network communication  
- Supports **real-time** message exchange between client and server  
- Implements a **TCP/IP connection** for reliable data transmission  
- Uses **multithreading** to handle multiple clients (future enhancement)  

## Prerequisites  
- Windows operating system  
- Microsoft Visual Studio or MinGW compiler  
- Basic knowledge of C++ and socket programming  

## Installation & Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/High-Performance-TCP-IP-Chat.git
cd High-Performance-TCP-IP-Chat
```

### 2. Compile the Code  
Use a C++ compiler like **MinGW** or **Visual Studio** to compile the code.  

#### Compile Server  
```sh
g++ server.cpp -o server -lws2_32
```

#### Compile Client  
```sh
g++ client.cpp -o client -lws2_32
```

## Usage  

### 1. Start the Server  
Run the server executable first to listen for incoming client connections.  
```sh
./server.exe
```

### 2. Start the Client  
Open another terminal and run the client executable to connect to the server.  
```sh
./client.exe
```

### 3. Start Chatting  
Once the client is connected to the server, both can exchange messages in real time.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Support for **multiple clients** using threads  
- Implement **encryption** for secure messaging  
- Add a **GUI interface** using Qt or another framework  
- Implement **cross-platform support**
